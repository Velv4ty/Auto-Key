# auto-key
Auto Key is a program wrote in python 3.15.3 that simulate keystrokesat a settable interval.

the amount of keystrokes its speed and the start/stop input are all customisable

The timer can also be turned on/off via a global hotkey combination (F5) for use in games and other applications without having to tab out.

this is heavily inspired by OP AUTO CLICKER
