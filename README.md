#Auto Key
Auto Key is a program written in Python 3.15.3 that simulates keystrokes at a customizable interval

The number of keystrokes their spee, and the start/stop input are all configurable

A global hotkey (F5) can also be used to toggle the timer on or off making it convenient for use in games or other applications without needing to tab out

This program is heavily inspired by OP Auto Clicker
